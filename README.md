# 🌱 Quine Garden

A self-replicating program that evolves every hour through deterministic mutations.

## 🧬 The Analogy: Digital DNA

This repository is not just code; it is a **living organism** with its own lifecycle.

### 📜 The Magic Letter (The Quine)
Imagine a letter that, when read, tells you how to write its exact copy. This is the **Genotype** (`quine.py`). It contains the instructions to reproduce itself.

### 🧬 DNA & RNA (The PR Flow)
1. **Transcription (The Quine Run)**: The program reads itself and prepares a new version.
2. **Translation (The PR)**: The system proposes the mutation via a **Pull Request**. This is like RNA carrying a potential genetic change.
3. **Biological Check (Workflow Verification)**: The system tests if the new code can still reproduce. If it can't, the PR is rejected, and a **Genetic Collapse Issue** is filed.
4. **Integration (The Merge)**: If healthy, the mutation is merged into the main lineage.

## 🤔 How It Works

1. **The Seed**: `quine.py` runs itself.
2. **The Mutation**: It looks at the current time to decide how to change (Deterministic Entropy).
3. **The Proposal**: It opens a [Pull Request](../../pulls) to merge the new mutation.
4. **The Report**: It files an [Issue](../../issues) describing the evolution or failure.

## 🛠️ Components for Humans

- `quine.py`: The living organism. **Do not handle** unless authorized for genetic engineering.
- `logger.py`: Records snapshots of every generation in `generations/`.
- `visualize.py`: Generates [STATISTICS.md](STATISTICS.md) to track size and line drift.
- `lineage.py`: Generates [LINEAGE.md](LINEAGE.md) (the family tree of emojis).
